## Problem
Forecast monthly airline passenger demand to understand long-term trend and seasonality.

## Data
Monthly airline passenger counts (1949–1960).

## Approach
- Time series decomposition
- Stationarity checks
- ARIMA/SARIMA modeling
- Time-aware train-test split

## Evaluation
- RMSE on test set
- Visual comparison of actual vs forecast

## Key Learnings
- Importance of seasonality
- Why random split fails for time series
- Limits of classical models
